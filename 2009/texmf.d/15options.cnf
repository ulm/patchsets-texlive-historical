%  Part 2: Options.

% If this option is set to true, `tex a.b' will look first for a.b.tex
% (within each path element), and then for a.b, i.e., we try standard
% extensions first.  If this is false, we first look for a.b and then
% a.b.tex, i.e., we try the name as-is first.
%
% Both names are always tried; the difference is the order in which they
% are tried.  The setting applies to all searches, not just .tex.
%
% This setting only affects names being looked up which *already* have
% an extension.  A name without an extension (e.g., `tex story') will
% always have an extension added first.
%
% The default is true, because we already avoid adding the standard
% extension(s) in the usual cases.  E.g., babel.sty will only look for
% babel.sty, not babel.sty.tex, regardless of this setting.
try_std_extension_first = t

% Enable system commands via \write18{...}.  When enabled fully (set to
% t), obviously insecure.  When enabled partially (set to p), only the
% commands listed in shell_escape_commands are allowed.  Although this
% is not fully secure either, it is much better, and so useful that we
% enable it for everything but bare tex.
shell_escape = f

% No spaces in this command list.  These programs either do not write
% any output files, respect openout_any, or have hard-coded restrictions similar
% or higher to openout_any=p.  And have no features (nor, to the best of our
% knowledge, obvious security holes) to invoke arbitrary other programs.
% 
% Unfortunately we found too many problems with shell_escape=p, so it
% should be treated as though it were just as dangerous as shell_escape=t.
shell_escape_commands = \
false

% These programs are our first goal when we can enable it.
%kpsewhich,fc-match,\
%repstopdf,\

% we'd like to allow:
% dvips - but external commands can be executed, need at least -R1.
% (img)convert (ImageMagick) - delegates.mgk possible misconfig, besides,
%   without Unix convert it hardly seems worth it, and Windows convert
%   is something completely different that destroys filesystems, so
%   skip it.
% epspdf, epstopdf, ps2pdf, pstopdf, rpdfcrop - need to respect openout_any,
%   and we need to make sure -dSAFER is used and no injection is possible.
% pygmentize - but is the filter feature insecure?
% ps4pdf - but it calls an unrestricted latex.
% texindy,xindy - but is the module feature insecure?
% ulqda - but requires optional SHA1.pm, so why bother.
% tex, latex, etc - but need to forbid --shell-escape, and inherit openout_any
% bibtex,bibtex8,makeindex, - don't respect openout_any

% plain TeX should remain unenhanced.
shell_escape.tex = f

% Allow TeX \openin, \openout, or \input on filenames starting with `.'
% (e.g., .rhosts) or outside the current tree (e.g., /etc/passwd)?
% a (any)        : any file can be opened.
% r (restricted) : disallow opening "dotfiles".
% p (paranoid)   : as `r' and disallow going to parent directories, and
%                  restrict absolute paths to be under $TEXMFOUTPUT.
openout_any = p
openin_any = a

% Write .log/.dvi/etc. files here, if the current directory is unwritable.
% TEXMFOUTPUT = /tmp

% If a dynamic file creation fails, log the command to this file, in
% either the current directory or TEXMFOUTPUT.  Set to the
% empty string or  0  to avoid logging.
MISSFONT_LOG = missfont.log

% Set to a colon-separated list of words specifying warnings to suppress.
% To suppress everything, use TEX_HUSH = all; this is currently equivalent to
% TEX_HUSH = checksum:lostchar:readable:special
% To suppress nothing, use TEX_HUSH = none or do not set the variable at all.
TEX_HUSH = none

% Allow TeX, and MF to parse the first line of an input file for
% the %&format construct.
parse_first_line = t

% But don't parse the first line if invoked as "tex", since we want that
% to remain Knuth-compatible.  The src_specials and
% file_line_error_style settings, as well as the options -enctex,
% -mltex, -8bit, etc., also affect this, but they are all off by default.
parse_first_line.tex = f

% Control file:line:error style messages.
file_line_error_style = f

% Enable the mktex... scripts by default?  These must be set to 0 or 1.
% Particular programs can and do override these settings, for example
% dvips's -M option.  Your first chance to specify whether the scripts
% are invoked by default is at configure time.
%
% These values are ignored if the script names are changed; e.g., if you
% set DVIPSMAKEPK to `foo', what counts is the value of the environment
% variable/config value `FOO', not the `MKTEXPK' value.

% Used by makempx to run TeX.  We use "etex" because MetaPost is
% expecting DVI, and not "tex" because we want first line parsing.
TEX = etex

% These variables specify the external program called for the
% interactive `e' option.  %d is replaced by the line number and %s by
% the current filename.  The default is specified at compile-time, and
% we let that stay in place since different platforms like different values.
